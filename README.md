#  Task 5: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction

##  Objective
Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer using machine learning techniques.

##  Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- File: `bank.csv`
- Delimiter: `;` (semicolon)

##  Skills Demonstrated
- Data exploration and visualization
- Classification using Logistic Regression & Decision Tree
- Business insight extraction

##  Steps Performed
1. Load and inspect data
2. Visualize patterns (e.g., job, age, marital status vs. loan acceptance)
3. Encode categorical features
4. Train Logistic Regression & Decision Tree
5. Evaluate performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

## ðŸ“Ž Output
- Classification report and accuracy for each model
- Visual insights into customer behaviors

##  Key Insight
The dataset revealed patterns about which customer segments are more likely to accept personal loans, especially based on job and age.
